# React-Calculator for a job interview
This is a basic calculator with the 4 basic operations. 
The calculator stores the last history result to perform other operations with the last result.

For the future, I would like to integrate the features of a scientific calculator

To test you must write the following commands in the terminal : 
- git clone https://github.com/Vassili7115/calculator-ekino.git and git pull origin master
- npm install
- npm install redux react-redux

Finally npm start !

## Techno : 
- React
- Redux (currently in training, I took the opportunity to try to integrate at best Redux in this project)
